    "Two charts are available to analyze your fine tuning job and sanity check that the training went smoothly:\n",
    "- Loss curve: Value of the loss function (how wrong the model is) over time during training process --> this curve should go down over time as the model weights converge towards the optimum. \n",
    "- Token Accuracy: Shows the accuracy of the model's predictions at the token level (e.g., words or subwords) over time during training. A higher token accuracy suggests that the model is better able to capture the nuances of the language and generate more accurate text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these charts has the metrics computed both on the training data and on the validation set. \n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze these plots, one should look for the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A smooth curve: A smooth curve indicates that the model is learning consistently. Sharp changes or spikes in the curve could indicate issues with the learning rate or data preprocessing.\n",
    "- Plateau: A plateau in the curve indicates that the model has stopped improving and further training may not be necessary.\n",
    "- Overfitting: If the training loss continues to decrease but the validation loss starts to increase, it could be a sign of overfitting. This means that the model is not generalizing well to new data and may perform poorly on unseen data.\n",
    "- Underfitting: If both the training and validation loss remain high, it could be a sign of underfitting. This means that the model is not learning the patterns in the data well enough and may need a more complex - architecture or more training data.\n",
    "- Optimal stopping point: By analyzing the loss curve and token accuracy plot, one can determine the optimal stopping point for training, where the model has reached its best performance without overfitting.\n",

    "Now head to the studio and ensure your curves look roughly like the below\n",

A checkpoint is a fully functional version of a model which can both be deployed and used as the target model for subsequent fine-tuning jobs. Checkpoints can be particularly useful, as they can provide a snapshot of your model prior to overfitting having occurred. \n",
