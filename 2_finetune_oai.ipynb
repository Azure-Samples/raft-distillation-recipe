    "Now that we've created labelled training data, we can fine tune our model using the Supervised Fine Tuning technique. Azure OpenAI uses LoRA to fine tune models efficiently. **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** finetuning of a Large Language Model is a technique used to adapt pre-trained language models to specific tasks efficiently and with fewer computational resources.  \n",
    "\n",
    " Instead of adjusting all the model parameters, LoRA introduces a small number of additional parameters (low-rank matrices) that modify the model's behavior. These new parameters are trained while keeping the original model's parameters mostly unchanged. This way, the model can learn the new task without the need for extensive computational resources or time.\n",
    "\n",
    " Azure OpenAI lets developers customize OpenAI models with their own data and easily deploy their custom model using an easy to use and affordable managed service.\n",
    "\n",
    " While Fine Tuning can be a complex process, Azure OpenAI abstracts away a lot of the complexity to make fine tuning accessible to any developer."

    "Fine tuning pricing on Azure OpenAI makes fine tuning experiment cost very predictable. Training pricing is based on the number of tokens you're training your model on. Therefore, it is very easy to predict and manage the cost of your finetuning experiments.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. If the number of epochs is too high: There's a risk of overfitting, where the model becomes too specialized in the training data and performs poorly on unseen data (examples that weren’t in your training dataset).\n",
